# 2D-manevuer-creator
an arduino code generation tool to generate arduino code from path measurements for a differential 2 wheeled Arduino robot

## How to use

 - Put the specs of your robot in the Main Tab
 - Create your path in the Sequence Tab
 - Copy the code generated in the Code Tab

Right now it is still buggy when using the curve path
