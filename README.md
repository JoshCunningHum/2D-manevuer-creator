# 2D-manevuer-creator
a highschool project, a tool for arduino code generation to produce arduino code from path measurements for a differential 2 wheeled Arduino robot

Extremely unreadable, will restructure this if I have free time

## How to use

 - Put the specs of your robot in the Main Inputs Tab

 - Create your path in the Sequence Tab

 - Copy the code generated in the Code Tab

 - Paste that shit (because it looks like shit) in your arduino IDE and call it through the name of the maneuver you provided (e.g. ``ThisWillMakeMeWinManeuver()`` )

Right now it is still buggy when using the curve path
